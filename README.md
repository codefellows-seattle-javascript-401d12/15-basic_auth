## About
The basic authorization app currently allows a user to sign up `POST` and sign in `GET`. The application will provide a light layer of encryption by hashing the password before storing it in the database. Each user gets 4 properties `email`, `password`, `username`, and `findHash`. When creating a user the `email`, `password`, and `username` are required. The `findHash` is generated by the application.
